“This was my first Chrome extension.
I focused on understanding popup–content communication and DOM detection rather than rushing features.”

Project Title: Job Application Autofiller

Overview: I built a simple Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) that does the work for you. With just one click of the "Autofill" button, the extension finds the right boxes on the page and fills them in automatically with chrome manifest v3

How it works:
The Popup: A clean little window with a single button. (Autofill form)
The Logic: When you click the button, a script looks at the webpage for words like "Email" or "Name."
The Magic: It instantly puts your saved info into those boxes so you can submit the form in seconds.

Setup & Installation:

1. Download/Clone the repository.

2. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.

3. Enable Developer Mode (top right).

4. Click Load unpacked and select this project folder.

How to Use:

open text.html file in google (alt+b).
open developer tools
Click the extension icon.
then click on job autofill
on console you will see autofill is working correctly

Click "Autofill Form" to populate fields like Name, Email, and Skills.
